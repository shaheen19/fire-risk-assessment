# Fire Risk Assessment
This repository contains data on the atmospheric composition and related weather conditions in the State of California, USA.  A folder containing burned areas (shape files) and Landsat8- images of the state of California.
The goal of this project is to assess the fire risks through understanding of the interactions between atmosphere and biosphere. The Landsat08 data will be used to identify and measure various types of vegetation and comparison with the atmospheric conditions will allow us to assess the accumulation of fuel during wildfire season, which normally last from May-October.
